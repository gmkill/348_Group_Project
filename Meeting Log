Purpose: Work on Project Management Plan and develop strategy for coding project
Attendance: David S, Daniel B, Lily Gray

What we did: David got a logic gate working with &,|,XOR,@. David, Daniel, and Lily had a brainstorming session about how to parse through expressions with extraneous information. We want to create one stack that stores the expression from left to right until it reaches the first right parentheses. Then, we want to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses and store the results in another stack. Repeat until done.
